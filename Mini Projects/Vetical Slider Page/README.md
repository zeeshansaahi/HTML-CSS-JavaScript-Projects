# VERTICAL SLIDER PAGE

## Project Information
This project is basically a landing page which is styled to scroll verticaly both upside and downside with two different sections of the page. When clicked on the up button, the left section of the page moves downwards while the right section moves to the up direction. Similarly when clicked on the down button, the left section of the page moves upward while the right section of the page moves downwards. You can scroll upto 4 times before going back to the starting position.
## HTML
